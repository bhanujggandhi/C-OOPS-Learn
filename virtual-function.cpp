/*
Prepend virtual keyword to the function definition â†’ virtual function.

The rule is that the compiler selects the function based on the contents of ptr, not type. Type is used in non-virtual case.

Here the compiler does not know what class the contents of ptr may contain. It may content address of an object of the Derv1 class or of the Derv2 class. At runtime, this is decided on the basis of content. When it is known what class is pointed to by ptr, the appropriate version is called. This is known as Late Binding.
